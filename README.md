# Computer Vision Presentation for Self Driving Cars

This is a Data Science Workshop  by UpCode Academy.

It gives an overview of Data Science and showcases the power of it by hacking the online dating site OkCupid.

The code in this jupyter notebook scrapes data from OkCupid users and runs some algorithms to obtain some conclusions over it.
